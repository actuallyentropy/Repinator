# Repinator
 A Discord bot for spaced repetition learning. Prompts are defined in a fill-in-the-blank format which allows for creating context-sensitive content like language grammar study, but can easily be adapted for contextless vocabulary study as well. Reviews can be performed in a server or through private messages.
 
 Repinator is inspired by the Japanese learning services WaniKani and Bunpro, and was created to be able to offer similar options for studying Korean in a small group.
